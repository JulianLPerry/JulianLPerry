Placing here as a publicly accessible version of my written tutorial, and accompanying slides, on multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) as a tool for small-area estimation. Both the slides and written guide start from theory and then demonstrate via example using survey data. Originally written for Harvard's STAT 160.
